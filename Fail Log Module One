What I was trying to Do
  I was trying to follow the instructions in the three exercises. 
  Exercise One was trying to learn how to use Markdown (which one of the tutorials also worked one)
  Exercise Two was setting up DHBox.
  Exercise Three was beginning to understand Github.
  
What I did
In Exercise One I had trouble understanding the new ways of writing and making stylistic changes.
I found it distracting and hard to concentrate one my thoughts while also trying to format it.
As a result, I think the idea flow is loose and doesn't make as much sense as I would like.
I made a mistake with the images and couldn't view them (Version 1). When the images were properly 
linked (Version 2), there were spelling and stylistic changes (Version 3). Version 4 is final.

In Exercise Two, I didn't have a lot of trouble because of the previous work in Markdown and the
Linux terminal

In Exercise Three, I understood what I was doing, but will have to revisit the instructions next time.

Things that were hard
Following the tutorials was not difficult, but the next time I try to do it on my own it will probably
take way more time or I will need to pull up Module One for reference several more times.

Thoughts on where to go next
I need to try Exercise Four and then write and publish the blogs on the readings. Then submit it all.
